1.      Using variables and macros to represent information rather than hardcode “magic” numbers makes for easy manipulation of varying data and cases. If it is hardcoded it would have to be changed every time a user changes their input. An example from this workshop is with the months. If the month is hard coded to be January if the user inputs 2 it would display January instead of the desired February. Another example is with the loops from this workshop. The loops are controlled and restricted to the macro LOG DAYS. If the days are hard-coded the whole code with the hardcoded days would have to be changed each time the number of desired log days would be changed. Lastly, it gives advantages to calculations. It would not be possible to do any sort of calculations with varying data if the “magic” numbers were hard coded as it would always change.
2.      We do not include additional logic that sums and performs averages inside the iteration because if an undesired value is entered it would incorrectly affect the calculations. If the user incorrectly inputs a value not within 0.0-5.0 it would add it to the running total variable ruining the calculation of the total rating.  Also, it validates the value is within the target range because it would have to meet the conditions of the iteration to exit the loop. if the user inputs -0.7 it would not allow it to leave the loop since it is outside of the target range, validating that the input must be within the range.
